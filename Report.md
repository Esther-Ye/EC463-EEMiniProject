# Assignment for Senior Capstone hardware miniproject

Please make your "report" as a text/markdown file "Report.md" in your GitHub miniproject repository.
Just a couple paragraphs is fine.
We are mainly interested in that you could get the Pi running and measuring, and you can plot the data by transferring the data to your laptop and plotting.

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS to your Raspberry Pi microSD card as in "Part 1" of Readme.md
2. Ensure you can run the [wifi_scan.py](./wifi_scan.py) on your Raspberry Pi, and that it creates JSON data files. We suggest doing this in the Senior Design lab near the window (collecting data from cars on the highway).
3. Copy the JSON data collected to your laptop. Ideally collect 15+ minutes of data so the plots are more meaningful.
4. Make a Report.md as noted above in your GitHub mini-project repository, with the plots you generated and any explanation/difficulties/discussion on your miniproject results.
