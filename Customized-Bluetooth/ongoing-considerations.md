So far the code outputs the addresses of the bluetooth devices detected.
Added the datetime function to the print statement but instead of writing when the device was detected, it outputs when the print function is processed. 

Checking if there is a time component already embedded in pybluez. 

Afterwards we can plot the data using histograms.
