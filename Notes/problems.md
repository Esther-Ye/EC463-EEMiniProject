# Things that were difficult:
1. ssh-ing into the pi (no ethernet, just secluded network)
2. the time it took to install all the packages (python updates, pandas, xarrray)
3. got errors (and am still getting them):
```sh
ERROR:root:no data recorded 2021-09-14T23_55_32
wlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning : Device or resource busy
```
